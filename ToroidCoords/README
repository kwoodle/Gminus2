E821 Note 352 "Analysis of the Magnetic Field for 1998"

NMR readings for the 17 probes requires about 2 sec during which time
the trolley moves 1 cm. Each NMR reading has an accuracy of about 0.05 ppm.
The trolley position is calrated from the peak OR steepest slope of the curve
as it passes a fixed probe. A linear interpolation between 36 fixed probe locations
is used to correct azimuth (in 1998, azimuth measured by potentiometer.) Short-time
jitter of trolley by +/- 1 cm. Avg. field inhomogeneity of 5 ppm/cm. Some 6000
readings per probe.

E821 Note 432 "Analysis of the Magnetic Field for 2000"

The dip at the inflector region seen in 1999 is gone since a new inflector was
used.
